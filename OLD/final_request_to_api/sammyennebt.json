Adaptability, humility and trust are areas I now value more and I continue to enjoy speaking to a wide range of people and learning something from everyone. \n\nA bank Treasurer at 24yrs old with the GFC in full force, I thought I was well prepared for the covid crisis, very wrong. Have learnt a lot in the last 6 years taking businesses to market during uncertain times and now bring a unique blend of start up rigour and experience across strategy, product, change transformation, risk experience and balance sheet management. â€‹\n\nI have advised and side hustled in a UK Venture Studio, an Escrow business in Dubai, a property development in Sydney, a restaurant in Gold Coast and a social media platform in Abu Dhabi.",
